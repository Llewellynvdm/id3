Changelog for 'id3'.

2004-029 (W05):
  created a unix manpage

2004-027 (W05):                                ---------[v0.72]-----------
  [CLI] Now supports directory wildcards (e.g. "mp3root/*/*/*_*.mp3")
    Be careful with this, mkay? ;)
  sedit.cpp:capitalize: now handles punctuation properly
    (so it will be "Love's" and "2nd", not "Love'S" and "2Nd")
  sedit.cpp: Added a "%-" modifier (all characters lowercase), and added
    removal of extraneous spaces (suppressed by the "%_" modifier)
  main.cpp: now uses ffindexp for solving wildcard match (see above)

2004-019 (W04):
  (Resumed development)
  varexp.h: added varexp::iterator class
  ffindexp.cpp: fleshed out base algorithm

2003-301 (W44):
  setid3.cpp:clipped_compare: added a more intelligent ID3v1 genre-lookup,
    so saying "alt" and "alternative", "prog.rock" and "progressive rock",
    "fast fusion" and "fast-fusion", "humour" and "humor", "psyche/adelic",
    etc, etc, will all resolve to the correct genre.
  setid3.cpp<>sedit.cpp: made smartID3::edit an independent function

2003-299 (W43):
  main:cpp: error messages to stderr instead of stdout, program now gives
    meaningful result codes.
  id3v2.c:11: fixed copyright notice. :)
  id3v2.c<>fileops.c: split into two components.
  fileops.c: replaced fopentmp with something conceptually simpler.
  makefile: made it somewhat more conformant. id3 is still too basic to
    warrant using autoconf, imo.

2003-296 (W43):                                ---------[v0.71]-----------
  main.cpp:dirvector: reads directory as a whole to avoid order mangling
  main.cpp: added version info to -h, and added verbose mode with timing
  main.cpp:67: now uses posix constant
  setid3:86: [CLI] added "%," as alternative to "%n", "%@" for "%:"
  varexp.cpp:19: no longer copies vectors around.
  Updated documentation

2003-269 (W39):
  main.cpp  : [CLI CHANGE!] -dFRAME is now -rFRAME to remove possible
    confusion when -d is used as a stacked parameter.
  id3v2.c:87: encapsulated tmpname handling in fopentmp(), added code that
    uses mktemp() to make id3v2 tag handling _much_ faster.

2003-267 (W39):
  setid3.cpp:38: made freshly written ID3v1 tags have an empty genre.
  id3v2.c:307  : don't rewrite files with no ID3v2 tags when removing
    ID3v2 tags from files.

2003-262 (W38):
  (Resumed development)
  main.cpp: [CLI CHANGE!] implemented command stacking, so
    '-nat Tr Art Tit' == '-n Tr -a Art -t Tit'

2003-218 (W32):                                ---------[v0.70]-----------
  id3v2.c:ID3_writef: [BUGFIX] Serious. tmpnam() does not guarantee to
    create filenames that can always be fed to rename() on all systems,
    thus causing files to disappear / remain in your temp dir.
    Fix: Added a copy routine/handler.
  setid3.cpp & setid3v2.cpp: now throw exceptions on serious errors
  varexp.h: better explanation of index-out-of-range error
  main.cpp: handles all exceptions, more consistent help messages

2003-216 (W32):
  id3v2.c: added check on tmpnam(0) returning NULL
  id3v2.c:66:  added safety to see if copyfile() halted because of eof
  setid3v2.cpp: [BUGFIX] Harmless. w_ptr constructor sometimes got an
    uninitialized allocation value (went by unnoticed because of
    alloc-on-write?). Fix: Removed this feature - unnecessary anyway.
  setid3v2.cpp: only read previous ID3v2 if necessary.

2003-198 (W29):
  added conditional stdint.h include, some dirent.h implementations need it

2003-189 (W28):                                ---------[v0.60]-----------
  First public release
  setid3.cpp: removed silly packing check
  setid3v2.cpp: added "&& src". Whoopsee! :)
  id3v2.c: writef() now writes ID3v2 tags to files < 10 bytes. :)

2003-185 (W27):
  setid3v2.cpp: made w_ptr a live object + added bad_alloc checks
  setid3v2.cpp: void* src + ID3_free -> voidp<> src (exception safety)
  setid3.cpp: Now emits CR/LF pairs for %n, violating ID3v2, but
    conforming to Winamp. I figure more people care about Winamp.

2003-184 (W27):
  Readme
  Added specifying genre per number

2003-183 (W27):
  Started changelog.
  Install
  More code cleaning. Removed implementation-dependency with rename()

2003-181 (W27):
  Code clean up + minor improvements (e.g. added [] to wildcard match)
  Bolted together (private) `id3' & (private) ID3v2 sources

Todo list:

  - Restructure smartID3 inheritance
    + Support for Ogg Vorbis
    + Support for APEv2
    + Support for Lyrics3 v2.0 (?)
  - Options for forcing re-packing id3v2 ("-s size")
  - Extend substitution capabilities (slices?)
  - Options for re-using existing tag values
  - Internationalization (Unicode)
  ? Shorthand Wildcards ("%n. %t.mp3" == -n %1 -t %2 "*. *.mp3")
  ? Join main.cpp & view.cpp

Thanks go out to everybody who has responded with questions, suggestions,
and bug reports!
