| building it on your system
-------------------------------------------------------------

Successfully compiled with:

 - GCC 2.95.3       (DJGPP, GNU/Linux)
 - GCC 3.x          (DJGPP, GNU/Linux, MinGW)
 - Intel C++ 7.1    (GNU/Linux)
 - Borland C++ 5.5  (Win32)

This program is mostly written in 100% portable ISO C/C++, so basically all
you need is a modern, standards-compliant C/C++ compiler. I'm not sure if
this includes MS Visual C++.

I recommend using DJGPP to build a 32bit DPMI program if you're using a
version of Windows 9X (e.g. 95, 98, Me) because of the kludgy support for
native Win32 console apps. Likewise, if you're using something based on NT
such as NT4, 2000 or XP, you should definitely build a native Win32 app.

===
Makefiles

Pick the makefile you need and rename it to 'makefile' or use 'make -f':

  'makefile'  is meant for generic GNU/BSD systems. If you want to use
  Intel C++ instead of GCC you will have to edit it. You can also use this
  file for building with MinGW (but 'clean' will probably not work.)

  'makefile.dj'  is for DOS systems using DJGPP v2

  'makefile.bcc'  is for building a Win32 executable for Borland C++ 5.5
  You might be able to use this file as a starting point when trying to
  compile with Intel C++ under Windows. I don't know.

===
Standard make targets

 make id3      - fully enabled executable (default)
 make id3l     - id3v1 only executable
 make all      - both executables
 make final    - same as all, but tries to strip / pack the executables
 make clean    - removes all files produced by make

'final' assumes you have UPX (http://upx.sourceforge.net/) installed on
Win32/DOS systems. You should have. :)

===
Customizing

You can set the 'ZERO_BASED' define to '1' in setid.cpp (or add -DZERO_BASED
to CFLAGS in your makefile) if you would like to start counting wildcards
in the commandline parameters at 0 instead of 1, making the range %0..%9 map
to the 1st .. 10th wildcard (instead of having %0 match the 10th wildcard)

Also in setid3.cpp: %n emits a CR/LF pair, to conform to Winamp behaviour,
even though ID3v2 documents mandate LF only. #define NO_CRLF or add -DNO_CRLF
to CFLAGS if you want strict behaviour.

If you, for some reason, happen to dislike having '%' as a special character,
you can replace it with whatever you want by changing the 'VAR' constant
in the definition of smartID3 in setid3.h.
