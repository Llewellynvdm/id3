| building it on your system
-------------------------------------------------------------

Successfully compiled with:

 - GCC 2.95.3       (DJGPP, GNU/Linux)
 - GCC 3.x          (DJGPP, GNU/Linux, MinGW)
 - Intel C++ 7.1    (GNU/Linux)
 - Borland C++ 5.5  (Win32)

This program is mostly written in 100% portable ISO C/C++, so basically all
you need is a modern, standards-compliant C/C++ compiler.

I recommend using DJGPP to build a 32bit DPMI program if you're using a
version of Windows 9X (e.g. 95, 98, Me) because of the kludgy support for
native Win32 console apps. Likewise, if you're using something based on NT
such as NT4, 2000 or XP, you should definitely build a native Win32 app.

===
Makefiles

Pick the makefile you need and rename it to 'makefile' or use 'make -f':

  'makefile'  is meant for generic GNU/BSD systems. You will have to edit it
  if you want to/need to use different settings. (You can also use this
  file for building with MinGW)

  'makefile.dj'  is for DOS systems using DJGPP v2

  'makefile.bcc'  is for building a Win32 executable for Borland C++ 5.5

===
Standard makefile targets:

 make id3           - fully enabled executable (default)
 make id3l          - id3v1 only executable
 make all           - both executables
 make final         - same as all, but tries to strip / pack the executables
 make clean         - removes all files produced by make

'final' assumes you have UPX (http://upx.sourceforge.net/) installed on
Win32/DOS systems. You should have. :)

Generic GNU/BSD makefile targets & variables:

 make install       - installs into the directory `$(prefix)/bin'
 make install-strip - like install, but strips executable of debug info
 make uninstall     - uninstall from `$(prefix)/bin'

Because id3 does not have a configure script (yet), you can only set
these variables as a make commandline parameter:

 prefix             - the prefix directory name  (def. `/usr/local')
 bindir             - your binary directory      (def. `$(prefix)/bin')
 binary             - name of the binary         (def. `id3')

E.g: "make install prefix=$HOME" to install in $HOME/bin instead.
See inside 'makefile' for more details.

===
Customizing

Some things you can tweak in the definition of the class `svar', in sedit.h:

Set the ZERO_BASED constant to 1 (or true), if you would like to start
counting wildcards in the commandline parameters at 0 instead of 1, making the
range %0..%9 map to the 1st .. 10th wildcard.

If you, for some reason, happen to dislike having '%' as a special character,
you can replace it with whatever you want by changing the 'VAR' constant.

Adding "-DUSE_TMPNAM" to CFLAGS will make sure id3v2.c uses tmpnam()
instead of mktemp() for generating temporary file names.
