       id3  is  a  mass tagger for audio files. This means it is
       meant  to  be  used  to non-interactively perform similar
       updates to the meta-information in any number of files in
       just a single command.

       Operations  performed  might consist of replacing certain
       information,   or  adding,  replacing,  or  removing  all
       meta-information present in an audio file.

       To  take  advantage  of  this,  it has the ability to use
       portions of filenames to fill in portions of a tag.

       id3  currently  supports  the  old-style  ID3 format with
       track-number  extension  (ID3  v1.1), as well as the more
       complicated  ID3v2  (ID3  v2.3.0) format. This also means
       use  is  pretty  much  limited to audio formats which use
       these formats, e.g, MPEG-1 Layer III.

       The options are processed in the order specified.

       filespec ...
            specifies the file(s) to be affected by the command.

            If  you  use wildcards, it is recommended to enclose
            the  specification  in  double  quotes (""). id3 has
            internal  shell pattern matching which will not work
            if your shell performs this function.

       -1
            write ID3 v1 tags (default). See `-2'.
       -2
            write  ID3 v2 tags. If both -1 and -2 are specified,
            both tag formats will be written.

       -d
            do  not  re-use  existing  tag  data.  If no new tag
            information  is  specified in conjunction with this,
            all selected tags will be removed.

       -t "title"
       -a "artist"
       -l "album"
       -y "year"
       -c "comment"
       -g "genre"
       -n "tracknr"
            add/replace  the  specified  fields  with the values
            given.  Use  of  "" is recommended, if not required.
            field  values  are parsed for substitution commands,
            see the section headed `SUBSTITUTION' below.

            Genres  can  be  specified  either  directly or with
            their assigned number, regardless of tag format.

       -dFRAME
            remove all occurrences of frames named `FRAME'. This
            is  meaningless  on  tag  formats that do not have a
            notion  of  `frames',  such  as  ID3 v1. Consult the
            format documentation for valid `FRAME' names.

       -wFRAME data
            add  / update a frame named `FRAME' with raw `data'.
            For  experts  only. Substitutions are performed, but
            `data'   is  NOT  checked  or  parsed  for  semantic
            correctness  or  conformance.  You're  on  your own.
            Again, consult the format documentation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       id3  can perform `printf-like' substitution on the values
       prior  to writing them to a tag. Note that if you want to
       use  this, you HAVE TO enclose the wildcard specification
       in  double  quotes so your shell does not perform pattern
       expansion on it.

      `%<modifiers>N' where N <- [0..9]
            replaced  with  the portion of the filename matching
            the Nth `*' wildcard in the file specification. 0 is
            taken to mean 10.

            Available <modifiers>:

            c    Capitalize the substituted value
            _    Do not replace underscores with spaces

      `%%'  replaced with a single `%'.

      `%n'  replaced with the newline ('\n') character
            (intended for use with -wFRAME)

      `%:'  replaced with the null (`\0') character
            (intended for use with -wFRAME)

       $ id3 -a "Stallman" -t "Free Software Song" fs_song.mp3
            Add a simple tag to a file.

       $ id3 -d *.mp3
            Removes all tags from all mp3's.

       $ id3 -a "TAFKAT" -n "%1" -t "%c2" "*. *.mp3"
            Sets id3 fields in correspondence with the files:
             01. my_song.mp3  [=>] "01" "My Song"
             02. untitled.mp3 [=>] "02" "Untitled"    etc..

       $ id3 -2 -dAPIC *.mp3
            Removes all embedded pictures from all mp3 files.

       $ id3 -2 -wUSLT "%:englyrics%:foo, bar%nlalala!%n" blaet.mp3
            Adds an ID3v2 lyric frame to blaet.mp3.

       The internal pattern matching emulates the normal pattern
       matching of `sh'. It supports ?, * and [].

       In  an  ambiguous  situation,  the  pattern  matcher will
       always  try  to  resolve  a  `*' wildcard to the shortest
       possible  sequence  of  tokens.  This  differs  from  the
       standard  behavior  of  regular  expressions,  however it
       tends to make sense in the context of filenames.

       E.g.: `*_*', `1_foo_bar' -> %1 == `1', not `1_foo'.

       Do  NOT  add ID3 tags to files for which it does not make
       sense,  i.e,  add  them only to MP3 files. In particular,
       do  not  add  ID3v2  tags  to OGG files, since ID3v2 tags
       start  at the beginning of the file, and thus will result
       in  corrupted  OGG  files.  Support for the OGG container
       format is planned in a future release.

       I  discourage  using  ID3v2  tags if not truly necessary.
       Working  with  ID3v2 tags might involve copying sensitive
       data  several  times,  introducing possible opportunities
       for  data  corruption and file fragmentation. And because
       ID3v2  is  complex,  program code is complex, and as such
       ore prone to contain errors.

       ID3v2  goes  way  beyond the demands of simple meta-data,
       and  tries  to  support embedding general purpose data in
       places where it shouldn't be. Do not use it this way.

       id3  has a built-in genre list of 148 genres. If pass the
       -g parameter a name instead of a number when using ID3v1,
       id3  tries  to  find  the  specified  genre in this list.
       Capitalization  doesn't  matter,  however  exact spelling
       does. For the genre numbers and spelling, see `id3v1.c'.

       id3  does not support ID3v2 v2.0 or earlier, neither does
       it  support  the  new ID3v2 v4.0 (yet?). It also does not
       support ID3v2 features as compression, encryption, ...
